                <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                    Pork and shrimp dim sum is a type of Chinese cuisine that consists of small, savory, bite-sized
                    dumplings, typically served steamed. The filling is made from ground pork and shrimp,
                    which are mixed with an array of flavorful seasonings,
                    including soy sauce, rice wine, sesame oil, scallions, and cilantro. The filling is then wrapped in
                    a thin layer of dough, which is often pleated to create a characteristic, purse-like shape. Once
                    steamed,
                    the dough becomes soft and pliant, while the filling retains its juicy texture and savory flavor.
                    Pork and shrimp dim sum is a popular dish that can be enjoyed as a snack or as part of a larger meal
                    in
                    Chinese cuisine.
                    It is known for its savory and slightly sweet flavor and is often served as a side dish or main
                    course in Chinese restaurants.
                    Fried rice is a versatile and popular dish in many Asian cuisines, including Chinese, Japanese, and
                    Thai.<br>
                    It typically consists of cooked rice that is stir-fried with various ingredients such as vegetables,
                    eggs, and meat, along with seasonings such as soy sauce, garlic, and ginger.
                    Fried rice is often served as a side dish or main course and can be customized to suit individual
                    tastes by using different ingredients or spices. It is a flavorful and
                    satisfying dish that is quick and easy to prepare, making it a popular choice for busy weeknight
                    meals or as a staple in takeout orders.
