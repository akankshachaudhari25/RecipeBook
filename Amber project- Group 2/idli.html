                <p style="font-size: 20px;">Idli is one of the most popular South Indian breakfast dishes made from
                    ground and fermented rice lentil batter. This soft, fluffy, and steamed savory cake is often served
                    with a combination of chutneys and sambar.

                    In this post, I am sharing a detailed full-proof recipe with step by steps photos, tips, and a video
                    on how to make the perfectly fermented idli batter at home in two ways using idli rice or idli rava
                    (rice rava) that will give the best, fluffy and soft idli. Bonus, you can also use this batter to
                    make dosa and uttapam.

                <p style="font-size: 20px;">Idli was a staple breakfast growing up and Mom would whip up the batter from
                    scratch. Her batter is always perfect consistency and ferments easily which is so important for
                    making soft idli. <br><br>

                    We as kids loved munching on those fresh hot pillowy soft idlis just on their own too and love
                    seeing the same sight with my kids now. <br><br>

                    Making soft fluffy idli is easy but it is an art that needs to be mastered. You need the right
                    ingredients and their proportion, grinding technique, and batter consistency for the batter to
                    ferment right thus resulting in soft idlis. <br><br>

                <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                    Idli or Idly is a soft and fluffy savory steamed cake made from fermented rice and lentil batter.
                    <br><br>
                    This savory rice cake is a popular and healthy South Indian food and a personal favorite too. It is
                    popular not only in Indian households but in Indian restaurants worldwide. <br><br>

                    The process of making idli involves 4 important steps - soaking the rice and lentils (urad dal/black
                    gram), blending the batter, fermenting the batter which enhances its nutrient value, and then
                    steaming the batter to make idli. <br><br>

                    Due to this unique preparation method, Idli is considered one of the healthiest food. <br><br>

                    Idli is naturally vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free and a healthy meal option for kids and adults.
                    <br><br>

                    It is commonly served with chutney and sambar and makes a delicious protein-packed meal. <br><br>

                    In this post, I share two ways to make the perfectly fermented idli batter and soft fluffy idli at
                    home from scratch. <br><br>

                    <li>
                        <p><strong> Rice -</strong> You can make idli batter using either Idli rice or Idli rava. Both
                            are easily available in Indian grocery stores or online.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong> Idli Rice - </strong> Idli rice is parboiled rice also known as ukda chawal. It is
                            short grain rice and is used specifically for making idli and dosa. This is the best rice
                            variety for making idli. You can substitute with any short or medium grain rice like sona
                            masoori if idli rice is not available. Long grain rice like basmati is not recommended for
                            making idlis as they are not as fluffy and soft.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong> Idli Rava -</strong> Idli rava is coarsely ground parboiled rice and also known as
                            cream of rice or rice rava or rice sooji. Note that it is different than regular rava,
                            sooji, or semolina which is made from wheat.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong> Lentil -</strong> I prefer using skinned whole white urad dal (black gram), also
                            known as Whole Urad Gota. It is also labeled as whole Matpe beans without husk. It is white
                            in color, without husk or skin, and round. You can also use split urad dal (white).

                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong> Poha -</strong> Poha or flattened rice is optional but highly recommend adding it
                            since it gives idli a lighter texture and aids fermentation. You can skip it if you don't
                            have it. Alternately sabudana can be used too.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong> Fenugreek seeds -</strong> Fenugreek seeds, methi seeds, or methi dana in Hindi help
                            with the fermentation process, enhance the nutritional value and lend a beautiful aroma to
                            the idlis. Although, too much methi will make the batter bitter so stick to the proportion
                            mentioned. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong> Salt -</strong> Use non-iodized salt like sea salt, rock salt only. Table salt or
                            Iodized salt has iodine and anticaking agents that interfere with the fermentation
                            processes.</p>

                <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">How to make Idli batter ?</h3><br>
                <p>
                    There are two ways to make idli batter. The first method is using Idli rice and the second is with
                    idli rava. The use of urad dal is common in both these methods it is just the rice variety that
                    varies</p>
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Using Idli rice -</strong> This is a traditional method for making idli using Idli
                            rice
                            or parboiled rice. For this method, you soak and grind both rice and urad dal before
                            fermenting.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Using Idli Rava -</strong> Idli rava is coarsely ground rice and this is a quicker
                            method for making idlis. Here you can just soak, drain and add the idli rava to the urad dal
                            batter for fermenting.
                    </li>
                    </p>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You will get pillowy soft idlis using both batters. Also, you can use both for making idli, dosa,
                    and
                    uttapam. However, there is a texture difference in both. <br><br>

                    Idli rava batter is more coarse while Idli rice batter is smoother since the rice is ground. Also
                    the
                    batter color and idli color with Idli rice are much whiter than that of idli rava. <br><br>

                    If I plan to make just idli and uttapam I prefer using Idli rava since I like the texture it gives.
                    <br><br>

                    If I plan to use the idli batter to make dosa the next day, I prefer going with idli rice. Having
                    said
                    that I have also made dosa using the Idly rava batter and they come out crispy too. <br><br>

                    In short, it's totally your preference whether you want to use Idly rice or Idli rava. <br><br>
                </p>
                <h3>DAL TO RICE RATIO</h3>
                <p>The ratio of dal to rice is very important for the perfectly soft idly. So whether you make it using
                    idly rice or idly rava stick to the ratio of 1:3 for dal rice. <br><br>

                    I know many prefer a ratio of 1:4 including restaurants but I follow my mom's recipe and she uses a
                    1:3 ratio. <br><br>

                    That means for every 1 cup of urad dal use 3 cups of rice or idli rava. <br><br>
                </p>
                <h3>GRINDING IDLI BATTER</h3>
                <p>
                    Another important step for making soft idli batter is the ground batter's consistency. It should be
                    light and fluffy. <br><br>
                    Traditionally, a wet grinder is used to make a fluffy batter. Nowadays most people including me
                    prefer making the batter in a blender since it's easy and convenient. <br><br>
                    I have been using Hamilton Beach Professional Juicer Mixer Grinder and love it. It reminds me of the
                    mixer my mom uses to grind her batter and is so nostalgic. <br><br>

                    This Mixer Grinder was sent to me by Hamilton Beach but after using it extensively I can say it's
                    now my go-to blender for Indian cooking and for making idli dosa batter. <br><br>

                    What I love is that it comes with three leakproof stainless steel jars with square sides which is
                    such a unique design. It is a powerful 1400W rated motor that effortlessly mixes and grinds the
                    toughest ingredients, both wet and dry. <br><br>

                    I use the biggest jar (1.5 Liters) for grinding idli batter and use the Preset functions to get the
                    soft fluffy idli batter. You can also do it manually too but the preset works like a charm and gives
                    consistent results every single time. <br><br>

                <h3>STEP BY STEP METHOD :-</h3><br>
                <h4>SOAKING AND GRINDING URAD DAL</h4>
                <div class="Ingrediants-image">
                    <img src="css/images/Soaking-and-grinding-urad-dal.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p>
                    1 - In a bowl, take urad dal and rinse 3-4 times or until the water runs clear. Then drain the water
                    completely. <br><br>

                    2 - add fenugreek seeds to the rinsed urad dal along with enough water (3 cups), and soak in water
                    for 6-8 hours or overnight. <br><br>

                    3 - After soaking, drain the water completely and transfer dal to a grinder along with ice-cold
                    water (1.25 cups). <br><br>

                    4 - Grind the urad dal to the light fluffy batter. I use my Hamilton Beach mixer grinder (preset -
                    wet hard and fine consistency) to achieve this. <br><br>
                </p>
                <div class="Ingrediants-image another-img">
                    <img src="css/images/Urad-dal-batter.jpg" alt="" >
                </div>
                <p>
                    4a - Test by adding a drop of the urad batter to a bowl of water. It should float. This indicates
                    the right batter consistency. <br><br>

                    4b - Transfer the ground dal to a large pot/bowl or Instant Pot steel pot. Make sure the bowl/pot
                    has enough room for the batter to rise. <br><br>

                    Now make the rest of the idli batter using either Idli rice or Idly rava. <br><br>
                </p><br><br>

                <p>
                    5a - Soak poha for 5-10 mins before grinding. You can either grind poha with urad dal or rice.
                    Either way is ok. <br><br>

                    6a - In a large bowl, take idli rice and rinse 3-4 times or until the water runs clear. Then drain
                    the water completely. Soak in enough water (4-5 cups) for 6-8 hours or overnight. <br><br>

                    7a - After soaking, drain the water completely and transfer the rice to the blender (or grinder)
                    along with poha. <br><br>

                    8a - Add ice-cold water (total of 1.5 cups) to the blender and grind to rice smooth or coarse paste
                    based on your preference. <br><br>

                    I grind rice in two batches using my Hamilton mixer grinder and use a preset, wet hard, and medium
                    consistency. <br><br>
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>9a - Transfer the ground rice to the pot with urad dal batter <br><br>

                    10a - Add non-iodized salt. I used sea salt. <br><br>

                    11a - Mix well using a spatula or preferably by hand to incorporate air and help fermentation. Mix
                    for 1-2 minutes or until both batters are well combined. <br><br>

                    12a - Batter consistency is very important. It should neither be too thick nor too thin. It should
                    be free-flowing and fall in ribbons that dissolve in a few seconds into the batter. The idli batter
                    with idli rice is now ready for fermentation. <br><br>

                </div>
                <p>
                    5b - In a bowl, take idli rava and rinse with water a few times, until the water runs clear. Drain
                    the water completely. Soak in enough water for 3-4 hours. Soak, drain and grind poha with Urad dal
                    or on its own since we will not be grinding the rava. <br><br>

                    6b and 7b - Squeeze out all the excess water by pressing the idli rava between your palms. Apply
                    pressure to drain maximum water. If there is water left it will make the batter runny. <br><br>


                    8b - Add this squeezed idli rava to urad dal batter. <br><br>
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>
                    9b - Squeeze out all the idli rava in the same manner and add to urad batter. Ideally, you don't need to grind idli rava but if you don't prefer the coarse texture, grind it too before adding. <br><br>  

10b - Add non-iodized salt. I used sea salt.  <br><br> 

11b - Mix well using a spatula or preferably hands to incorporate air and help fermentation. Mix for 1-2 minutes or until both batters are well combined. <br><br>

12b - Batter consistency is very important. It should neither be too thick nor too thin. Idli rava batter consistency should be drop consistency and fall in ribbons in v shape that dissolve in a few seconds into the batter. <br><br>

Idli batter with idli rava is now ready for fermentation. You can check the Idli recipe with the Idli rava video here. <br><br>

                <h3>FERMENTING IDLI BATTER</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The fermentation process is the same whether you made Idli batter using idli rava or idli rice. <br><br>
                    

You can ferment idli batter the traditional way or in the oven or use Instant Pot. I love using Instant Pot since it provides consistent temperature and results every single time.  <br><br>


<strong>Instant Pot Fermentation Method - </strong> Place the Instant Pot steel pot inside the Instant Pot and cover it with a glass lid. Do not use the Instant pot lid as if the batter overflows it can lock the lid. So always use a glass see-through lid. <br><br>

Set the Instant pot on yogurt mode and adjust the time for 12 hours. Depending on where you live it can take anywhere from 8-15 hours.  <br><br>

<strong>Traditional Method -</strong> If you live in a warmer climate, you can place the pot with the batter on the counter. Cover it with a lid (not air-tight) and ferment overnight or for 8-12 hours. <br><br>

<strong>Oven Method -</strong> For colder climates, keep it in a warm place like oven (turned off). Keep the oven light on as it helps provide the warmth needed.  <br><br>

Additionally, you can preheat the oven to 160°F and then turn it off. Wait 5 mins and then place the pot with batter in this oven. This is how I fermented batter prior to Instant Pot. <br><br>

                    Pics shown in 13 and 14 are for Idli batter made with idli rice and 15, 16 are for a batter with idli rava. <br><br>

13 and 15 - After fermentation, the batter will double, rise and turn light, fluffy and bubbly. It will also have a slightly sour aroma.  <br><br>

14 and 16 - Gently mix the batter 1-2 times to even it out. This will deflate the batter a bit. Do not over mix as that will cause the idli to rise and go flat after steaming. <br><br>

                <br><h3>HOW TO MAKE SOFT IDLI (STEPWISE)</h3><br>
                <p>The steaming process remains the same for Idli batter with idli rava and idli rice</p>
                <div class="Ingrediants-image">
                    <img src="css/images/Steaming-idlis-using-Instant-Pot.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p>
                    17 - Grease idli plates lightly with oil or ghee. <br><br>
                

18 - Mix the batter once and fill the idli mold with batter. Don't fill it all the way up leave some room to avoid spilling over.  <br><br>

Tip: Stack the idli plates on the stand such that the bottom curve of the upper mold is in between the molds of the lower plate. This will give space for the idli to expand and will not stick to the upper mold. <br><br>

19 and 20 - You can steam idli using an idly steamer, pressure cooker, regular pot with lid, or using an Instant pot (my preferred method).  <br><br>

<strong>Steaming idli in a pressure cooker or regular pot -</strong> Bring 2 cups of water to a boil and place the idli stand inside. Cover with the lid or pressure cooker lid without the weight (whistle) and steam for 10-12 mins (with external timer) on high heat. <br><br>

<strong>Steaming idli using Instant Pot -</strong> add 1.5 cups of water to instant pot steel pot and start on sauté. Once the water comes to a boil, place the idli stand in the pot and press cancel. Close the lid and position the pressure value in the venting position. Press the Steam button and put an external timer for 12 mins. <br><br>
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>
                    21 - When the external timer rings, press cancel. Wait for 5 mins before opening the lid. <br><br>

22 - Remove the idly stand out, cool for 2-3 mins. Insert a knife in the center of the idli, it should come out clean without any batter stuck to it. This indicates idli is done! <br><br>

23 - Using a wet spoon, remove the idli. <br><br>

24 - Soft spongy idli is ready!! Serve idli fresh and hot with chutney and sambar. Enjoy!!  <br><br>
